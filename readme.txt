# Automation Project – PWC Assessment

## Project Overview
This project automates the processing of employee data using **UiPath** and **Python**.  
It includes data cleansing, email consolidation, web automation (stock data extraction), and a Python-based analysis to generate a summary report.

## Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**
   - **UiPath Studio** installed (Community or Enterprise version).  
   - **Python 3.x** installed.  
   - Required Python packages: `pandas`, `openpyxl` (install via `pip install pandas openpyxl`).  
   - Excel installed on the machine.
   - The input file `Employees_Raw.xlsx` should be present in uiPath project folder or in the specified input directory "\Data\DataCleansing\Input\Employees_Raw.xlsx".  


2. **UiPath Automation**
   - Open the `UiPath_Project.zip` and extract the project.  
   - Open `Main.xaml` in UiPath Studio.  
   - Run the workflow.  
   - Outputs from ** DataCleansing**, **Web Automation** and **Mail Consolidation** are included in the UiPath project folder "Data".

3. **Python Analysis**
   - Navigate to the `Python_Task` folder.  
   - Ensure `Employees_Cleaned.xlsx` is in the same folder.  
   - Run `employee_analysis.py` using Python 3.  
   - A single summary file `Summary_Report.csv` will be generated in the same folder.

## Assumptions
- The Excel file `Employees_Cleaned.xlsx` exists and is accessible.  
- UiPath Studio and Python 3.x are installed on the machine.  
- Necessary Python packages are installed (`pandas`, `openpyxl`).  
- Output files from **Web Automation** and **Mail Consolidation** are included in the UiPath project.  
- Email addresses in the dataset are valid and contain `@`.  
- Company names in the dataset are consistent.
